## Generalized Data Structure Library

This project is considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types
of data structure.
We provide the readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced
operations on linear, non linear data structure in an object oriented way.

## How to Run
```bash
g++ GenericDataStructure.cpp
